Edu ocean is a project which is related to the student/education system. In this idea, we facilitate the education institutes to reach the maximum target audience. Basically, Edu ocean makes possible students and institute to come at one platform. Where both students and institutes get the benefit. As a student, they get all the information related to the institutes. Like what kind of education institutes offer all types of information about (description, google map location, contact) also admission is open or not what is fees of that education. As an institute, they get the target audience which needs their education and institutes they can display all their information at this platform no need to advertise to let the student know about education. At a platform level, this project makes the education system more competent because all institute gives their best to get students. And students have many choices to get the best education they need to get educated.
